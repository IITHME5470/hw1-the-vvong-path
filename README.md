## Question 1

### Directory Structure:

* `input` directory contains the input file: `input.in` which contains a single integer number
* `output` directory is initially empty, will store the output of the main program
* `main.c` is the source code for question 1
* `run_program.sh` is a shell script for viewing file sizes. (More info included below)

### Instructions:

* Ensure that the `input` directory contains `input.in` file with a single integer number representing the value `n`.
* Create the output directory `output/`.
* Compile the main program using the command `gcc main.c`
* Run the executable using the command `./a.out`
* The user is prompted to enter the value of file format they wish to be generated: 0 is for ASCII and 1 is for BInary format.
* The output generated by the main program is stored in the `output` directory.

### Shell Script `run_program.sh`:

* This is a convenience script that takes input value `n` and runs the source code for both ASCII and Binary format flags and outputs the file sizes of output files generated.
* Set executable permissions on shell script using: `chmod +x run_program.sh`
* To run the script: `./run_program.sh`
* The results will be printed on the terminal.

## Question 2

### Directory Structure:

* `main.c` contains the source code for question 2
* `Plots.ipynb` contains python script for generating plot of n vs avg time taken to verify eigenvector
* Make sure that the `inputfiles` directory is outside the directory containing the `main.c` source code.

### Instructions:

* Compiling the program: `gcc main.c`
* Run the executable: `./a.out`
* The results of the program are printed on the terminal
* For vectors that are indeed eigen vectors, their eigen value is also appended to the input file of the corresponding eigen vector.
* The program also creates a file `timetaken.log` that contains information about average time taken to verify an eigenvector for each input size n.
